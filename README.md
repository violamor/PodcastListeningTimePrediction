The project uses the **Podcast Dataset** available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ysthehurricane/podcast-listening-time-prediction-dataset/data), which includes metadata and engagement metrics for various podcast episodes.  
Each record contains features such as:

- **Podcast Name**  
- **Episode Length (minutes)**  
- **Publication Day**  
- **Genre** (Technology, Comedy, Health, etc...)
